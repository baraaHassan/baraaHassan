### Hi I am Baraa, a Master's Thesis student at the University of Bonn ðŸ‘‹ 
### Since having a chronic disease, I am extra motivated to solve the problems of Healthcare using Deep Reinforcement Learning, Causal Inference, and Uncertainity Methods; to help patients having better quality life.
## ðŸ¤” I am interested in Deep Learning, Offline Reinforcement Learning, Causal Inference, Evidential Deep Learning, Uncertainity Methods, and Generative Models.
- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working as Research Assistant at InfAI on a project funded by EKFZ**
    - **My responsibilities are**:
      1. Collecting the AI system requirements from Clinicians.
      2. Doing research and designing novel Deep Reinforcement Learning solutions to be published in the research venues.
      3. Designing the architecutre of and developing the preprocessing pipeline, that connect the raw data from Hospital machines to the AI model.
      5. Daignosing and trouble shooting the whole pipeline (i.e from the raw data to the AI).
     - **Extra activities**
        1. Leading the Deep Reinforcement Learning reading group of InfAI AI team.
     - **What I learned during this position**
       1. I learned how to learn a new topic without a prior knowledge about and with no supervision.
       2. I learned how do research.
       3. I recorded in a manifest all the conferences, summer schools, colloquiums/seminars/symposiums, graduate courses, and institute/professors youtube channel/website/github related to the topic that I was working on (i.e Deep Reinforcement Learning in Healthcare).
       4. I have read many papers and many surveys related to the topic that I was working on.
       5. I attended 3 graduate courses related to the topic I was working on.
       6. I watched many conference tutorials and semianrs while I was searching for new ideas.
       7. I set a routine of working in a certian time everyday, and of switching between the TODO tasks -to not get bored quickly-, to improve my productivity.
       8. My problem solving skills increased, as I was working on ill-defined problem.
       9. My debugging and troubleshooting skills increased, as I was debugging a very complex pipeline (that contains many layers).
 - ðŸŒ± **Iâ€™m currently learning Causal Inference and Uncertainity Methods (i.e Energy-based Models, Bayesian Models,and etc.)**

<!-- ### About me
#### Since having a chronic disease, I am extra motivated to solve the problems of Healthcare using Deep Reinforcement Learning, Causal Inference, and Uncertainity Methods; to help patients having better quality life.
#### ðŸ¤” I am interested in Deep Learning, Offline Reinforcement Learning, Causal Inference, Evidential Deep Learning, Uncertainity Methods, and Generative Models.
- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working as Research Assistant at InfAI on a project funded by EKFZ**
    - **My responsibilities are**:
      - Understanding the business (the medical background) via interacting with the stakeholders/clinicians.
      - Understanding different datasets (i.e. collected in different countries by different teams) via performing data analysis/exploration. 
      - Data preprocessing/preparation for solving medical data issues, I.g. imputing missing time
points, inferring missing variables, anomaly detection, etc.
      - implementing algorithms for defining the patientsâ€™ cohort, and ignoring non-critical cases.
      - Implementing statistical methods for evaluating the data pereprocessing.
      - Modeling the medical data using Deep Reinforcement algorithms.
      - Implementing statistical methods for mentoring the pipeline performance.
      - Evaluating the Deep Reinforcement algorithms performance.

     - **Extra activities**:
        - Leading the Deep Reinforcement Learning reading group of InfAI AI team.
        - I am doing a podcast on my youtube channel, where I host interviews with the researchers from different fields; to talk about their research and their personal journey.
     - **What I learned during this position**:
       - I learned how to learn a new topic without prior knowledge about.
       - I learned how to do research.
       - I recorded in a manifest all the conferences, summer schools, colloquiums/seminars/symposiums, graduate courses, and institute/professors youtube channel/website/github related to the topic that I was working on (i.e Deep Reinforcement Learning in Healthcare).
       - I have read many papers and many surveys related to the topic that I was working on.
       - I attended 3 graduate courses related to the topic I was working on.
       - I watched many conference tutorials and seminars while I was searching for new ideas.
       - I set a routine of working in a certain time everyday, and of switching between the TODO tasks -to keep the routine sustainable-, to improve my productivity.
       - My problem solving skills increased, as I was working on an ill-defined problem.
       - My debugging and troubleshooting skills increased, as I was debugging a very complex pipeline (that contains many layers).
- ðŸ’ª **What I brought to the teams that I joined:**
    - Problem-solving skills. In many situations during university and work experience, I was finding the ad-hoc solution without knowing that there was a solution/algorithm already for such a category of problems. 
    in Master's during study groups, we read a lecture that mentions that the previous method has problem X. While we are discussing, I suggest a solution, that we find the exact or part of or even nearby solution that is being suggested in the rest of the lecture.
    - I am a big fan of mathematics. Where I solve mathematical puzzles as a hobby. I even (during the Bachelor's) was reading the resource book of Calculus and Physics. In high school, when I got bored, or I wanted to take a break from studying, I was solving Math equations.
    - I have a reasoning mindset that helps me to think about many things deeply and not accept the explicit reason/observation. As Feynman said there are different levels of understanding, there is someone you give him a very brief answer, and he is satisfied, there is someone else who needs more analysis and more explanation. I am the silly person who needs a detailed analysis :D. I use it on coding, understanding computer science subjects deeply and solving problems.
    - I think (which is hard to evaluate that by myself :D) I am a creative person. As I do not always follow the NaÃ¯ve way of solving an issue, and at the same time not the complex one, I try to find the simple feasible solution which sometimes results in creative ideas. Also I have the ability to merge between primitive ideas to bring a brand new idea.
    - I am a proactive person, where I initiated many new ideas in my current team. I was even leading the Deep Reinforcement Learning group in the institute.
    - I am a committed person, where I always do my best to support my team, and to solve the barriers that might stop us from meeting the deadlines. 
    - I am a curious person who like to learn and know about many topics. Additionally, I have the patience and the motivation to always learn, even things I don't have a prior knowledge about.
    - I have good debugging skills, which I developed through my training for the problem-solving contests that I joined. As well, recently this skill improved more and more while I am working in healthcare context.
    - I am passioned about Machine Learning, where I am following - on twitter and linkedin -, the pioneer researchers in the field, to be always up to date to all recent researches in the field. Besides, I always try to analyze the code of those new researches.
    - I am trying always to improve myself, and not stuck in a comfort zone with no further improvements
    - I am always invest time to learn -and plan- to improve my productivity, and my learning to learn skill.
    - I have interpersonal skills, where I try always to keep a good relationship with my colleagues.`` -->

### Hi I am Baraa, a Master's Thesis student at the University of Bonn ðŸ‘‹ 
### Since having a chronic disease, I am extra motivated to solve the problems of Healthcare using Deep Reinforcement Learning, Causal Inference, and Uncertainity Methods; to help patients having better quality life.
## ðŸ¤” I am interested in Deep Learning, Offline Reinforcement Learning, Causal Inference, Evidential Deep Learning, Uncertainity Methods, and Generative Models.
- ðŸ”­ **Iâ€™m currently working as Research Assistant at InfAI on a project funded by EKFZ**
    - **My responsibilities are**:
      - Collecting the AI system requirements from Clinicians.
      - Designing and implementing the architecture of the data pipeline, that process the raw data coming from the hospital, and put it in the form of the input of the AI model. 
      - Implementing algorithms to solve the medical data issues, such as imputing missing time points, inferring missing variables, detecting the noise in measurements and removing them, synchronizing the same data coming from different machines and prioritizing the most accurate one, and converting the different measurement units - of the same variable - to make same variables having same measurements.
      - implementing algorithms to define the patientsâ€™ cohort, and ignoring non-critical cases.
      - Doing research and proposing novel Deep Reinforcement Learning solutions to be published in the research venues.
      - Diagnosing and troubleshooting the whole pipeline (i.e. from the raw data to the AI).
      - Implementing statistical methods for mentoring the pipeline performance.
      - Putting innovative ideas to optimize the entire pipeline, as the inference time is critical.

     - **Extra activities**:
        - Leading the Deep Reinforcement Learning reading group of InfAI AI team.
        - I am doing a podcast on my youtube channel, where I host interviews with the researchers from different fields; to talk about their research and their personal journey.
     - **What I learned during this position**:
       - I learned how to learn a new topic without prior knowledge about.
       - I learned how to do research.
       - I recorded in a manifest all the conferences, summer schools, colloquiums/seminars/symposiums, graduate courses, and institute/professors youtube channel/website/github related to the topic that I was working on (i.e Deep Reinforcement Learning in Healthcare).
       - I have read many papers and many surveys related to the topic that I was working on.
       - I attended 3 graduate courses related to the topic I was working on.
       - I watched many conference tutorials and seminars while I was searching for new ideas.
       - I set a routine of working in a certain time everyday, and of switching between the TODO tasks -to keep the routine sustainable-, to improve my productivity.
       - My problem solving skills increased, as I was working on an ill-defined problem.
       - My debugging and troubleshooting skills increased, as I was debugging a very complex pipeline (that contains many layers).
- ðŸ’ª **What I brought to the teams that I joined:**
    - Problem-solving skills. In many situations during university and work experience, I was finding the ad-hoc solution without knowing that there was a solution/algorithm already for such a category of problems. 
    in Master's during study groups, we read a lecture that mentions that the previous method has problem X. While we are discussing, I suggest a solution, that we find the exact or part of or even nearby solution that is being suggested in the rest of the lecture.
    - I am a big fan of mathematics. Where I solve mathematical puzzles as a hobby. I even (during the Bachelor's) was reading the resource book of Calculus and Physics. In high school, when I got bored, or I wanted to take a break from studying, I was solving Math equations.
    - I have a reasoning mindset that helps me to think about many things deeply and not accept the explicit reason/observation. As Feynman said there are different levels of understanding, there is someone you give him a very brief answer, and he is satisfied, there is someone else who needs more analysis and more explanation. I am the silly person who needs a detailed analysis :D. I use it on coding, understanding computer science subjects deeply and solving problems.
    - I think (which is hard to evaluate that by myself :D) I am a creative person. As I do not always follow the NaÃ¯ve way of solving an issue, and at the same time not the complex one, I try to find the simple feasible solution which sometimes results in creative ideas. Also I have the ability to merge between primitive ideas to bring a brand new idea.
    - I am a proactive person, where I initiated many new ideas in my current team. I was even leading the Deep Reinforcement Learning group in the institute.
    - I am a committed person, where I always do my best to support my team, and to solve the barriers that might stop us from meeting the deadlines. 
    - I am a curious person who like to learn and know about many topics. Additionally, I have the patience and the motivation to always learn, even things I don't have a prior knowledge about.
    - I have good debugging skills, which I developed through my training for the problem-solving contests that I joined. As well, recently this skill improved more and more while I am working in healthcare context.
    - I am passioned about Machine Learning, where I am following - on twitter and linkedin -, the pioneer researchers in the field, to be always up to date to all recent researches in the field. Besides, I always try to analyze the code of those new researches.
    - I am trying always to improve myself, and not stuck in a comfort zone with no further improvements
    - I am always invest time to learn -and plan- to improve my productivity, and my learning to learn skill.
    - I have interpersonal skills, where I try always to keep a good relationship with my colleagues.``
